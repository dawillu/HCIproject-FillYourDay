## 📅 **Project Overview**

* **Type:** UX/UI Design & Research
* **Context:** Improving engagement in shared green/business spaces.
* **Goal:** To create a seamless digital companion that helps users discover events, services, and community activities.

## 🔍 **The Challenge**

Through initial observation and research, we identified a disconnection between the park's facilities and its users.

* **Fragmentation:** Information about events and services was scattered across different channels.
* **Low Engagement:** Users were often unaware of the activities happening around them.
* **Navigation:** New visitors found it difficult to locate specific amenities or meeting points.

**Life@Park** was designed as a mobile-responsive web application that solves these issues by providing:

1.  **Unified Event Hub:** A real-time calendar of all park activities.
2.  **Community Connection:** Features that allow users to interact and share experiences.
3.  **Smart Navigation:** Easy access to park services and location details.
